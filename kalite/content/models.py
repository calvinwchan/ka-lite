"""
Models for storing content in structured trees with topic nodes.

Contents are editable by users, and thus there is a Draft inheritor for
different node types which is detached from the tree.

Current limitations:
 - A user cannot draft a different location in the tree.
 - Previous tree attachments are not maintained automatically, however
   leaving a copy of a node in a previous location with deleted=True
   is possible

Initially, this is thought to store all content as we start to only use JSON
data for importing and exporting. This is a long-term goal.

YAGNI (You Aren't Going to Need It): Much meta data is possible, please do not
add fields before a specific use case has occurred.
